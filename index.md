Greetings! I am a Research Associate with the [Speech Group](https://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/Main/Speech/WebHome) in the [Machine Intelligence Laboratory](https://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/), <u>University of Cambridge</u> (2022-) working with Professor [Mark Gales](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~mjfg/). Prior to that, I was a post-doc in <u>King's College London</u> (2021-2022) working with Professor [Zoran Cvetkovic](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/zoran-cvetkovic). I did my first post-doc in the Centre for Speech Technology Research ([CSTR](https://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/)), <u>University of Edinburgh</u> (2018-2021) working with Professor [Steve Renals](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/stephen-renals) and Dr [Peter Bell](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/peter-bell).
